## More Plugins & How to Contribute Your Own

The plugins shown here are only a smaller selection of those available.  You can find more themes on [our Wiki][].

You can even [contribute][] your own plugin to the community and we'll feature it here.  While you can freely add your plugin to [our Wiki][], if you'd also like to be included on this page, you can follow the simple instructions in our [Submission Guidelines][].

We appreciate any and all contributions, whether you've created something new or restored an obsolete plugin, we'd love to see it!
