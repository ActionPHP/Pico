## Contribute

Are you are interested in contributing to the development of Pico?

For the basics of creating a **plugin**, **theme** or even contributing to the **Pico core**, we've setup a comprehensive set of [development documentation](/plugin-dev.html) to get you started.

You may also see our [class documentation]({{ site.base_url }}/phpDoc/master) for a deeper understanding of Pico's underlying code.
