## Getting Help

### Getting Help as a user
If you want to get started using Pico, please refer to the [user docs][HelpUserDocs] (you're reading them right now!). Please read the [upgrade notes][HelpUpgrade] if you want to upgrade from Pico 0.8 or 0.9 to Pico 1.0. You can find officially supported plugins and themes on [our website][OfficialPlugins]. A greater choice of third-party plugins and themes can be found in our [Wiki][] on the [plugins][WikiPlugins] or [themes][WikiThemes] pages respectively. If you want to create your own plugin or theme, please refer to the ["Getting Help as a developer" section](#getting-help-as-a-developer) below.

### Getting Help as a developer
If you're a developer, please refer to the ["Contribute" section](#contribute) below and our [contribution guidelines][ContributionGuidelines]. To get you started with creating a plugin or theme, please read the [dev docs on our website][HelpDevDocs].

### You still need help or experience a problem with Pico?
When the docs can't answer your question or when you're experiencing problems with Pico, please don't hesitate to create a new [Issue][Issues] on GitHub. Concerning problems with plugins or themes, please refer to the website of the developer of this plugin or theme.

**Before creating a new Issue,** please make sure the problem wasn't reported yet using [GitHubs search engine][IssuesSearch]. Please describe your issue as clear as possible and always include steps to reproduce the problem.
