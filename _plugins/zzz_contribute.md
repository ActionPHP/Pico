Have you made your own plugin and you'd like to see it featured here?  You're in luck!  We're always interested in new submissions.

Our entire website is featured on [GitHub][gh-pages].  Submitting a new item for this gallery is as easy as creating a [Pull Request][].  Head over to our [Submission Guidelines][], where you can learn more about how to structure and format your submission.

We appreciate any and all contributions, whether you've created something new or restored an obsolete plugin, we'd love to see it!  And most importantly, thank you for your interest in Pico!  We're a small project, and we couldn't get by without the support of our Community.
