# Basics
Creating your own content for Pico is *easy*.

Inside the root Pico folder, all *themes* reside in the `themes` directory, and all *plugins* in the `plugins` directory.

If you want to contribute to Picos core please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub.
